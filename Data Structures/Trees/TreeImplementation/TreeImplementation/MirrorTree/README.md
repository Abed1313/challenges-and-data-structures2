# Mirror Tree
This implementation involves a binary tree data structure with the following key features: insertion, inorder traversal, and optional tree mirroring. The binary tree is built using nodes, each containing a value and pointers to left and right children. The tree's behavior is determined by the structure of its nodes, and the operations implemented on the tree allow for a variety of manipulations and data retrieval.
