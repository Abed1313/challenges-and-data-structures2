# Linked List Merge Sorted Lists Challenge

## Challenge Description:
You are required to implement a function that merges two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted linked list. The function should take the head nodes of the two linked lists as input and merge them in a way that the resulting linked list remains sorted. The merged list should replace the current list represented by the Head node of the class.
