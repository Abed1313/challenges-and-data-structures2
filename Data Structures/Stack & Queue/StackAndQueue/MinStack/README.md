# Min Stack Challenge
## Challenge Description:
The provided code implements a specialized stack data structure called MinStack. This stack is designed not only to perform the typical stack operations such as push, pop, and top, but also to efficiently track and retrieve the minimum element in the stack at any given time. The MinStack is particularly useful in scenarios where quick access to the minimum value is required alongside standard stack operations.
